### A sane way to access MAC addresses in the IEEE MA-L/OUI public listing.

The IEEE MA-L/OUI listing used to be a horrid mess of mixed whitespace
characters and duplicate information. `macdb` attempted to correct those errors
by recreating the listing in common, parsable formats.

### Update:

The IEEE now provides a much easier way to view the assignments.  I recommend
visiting their updated [registry][registry]. If you're still interested in the
original listing you can find something like it [here][original_listing].
